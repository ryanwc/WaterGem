# WaterGem

Easily find and refill your most precious scarce resource while saving money and the environment.

# Description

Locals and tourists do not drink the water in Thailand.  Locals use reverse osmosis water stations scattered throughout the cities, but tourists buy expensive bottled water, hurting both their wallets and the environment.

WaterGem helps you easily locate those water stations -- the hidden gems that let you refill a 1.5 liter bottle with clean, safe drinking water for 1 baht (about 3 US cents).
